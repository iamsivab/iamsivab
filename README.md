_I`ve always taken life as a journey from one experience to another. So far it has been a road full of interesting events and people. Full of love and happiness and also there has been lots of letting go of events, places, and people. I`ve never stopped creating new life events because in my eyes life is a pure act of creation full of opportunities that arise from every new moment_

Our data are something that fuels the meaning of life. With data, we create our realities. That is why my journey has taken me to work with data.

The journey has taken me through education in University College Cork where I will be graduating with a Postgraduate degree in Data Science and Analytics. During University time I was an active member of a student organization. It gave me good knowledge about corporation lifestyle, organizing of events and abilities to communicate with people from various fields of expertise.

```` Whether an emerging brand or an established presence rolling out a new product or service, I work closely with my clients on constructing an immersive narrative that can grow and evolve to define a brand. From there, I provide all the building blocks necessary to turn a project from an idea to a completed suite of marketing capital.. ````

I operate under a very simple philosophy: that top-tier work is the result of communication with my clients, collaboration on common goals, and clarity of intent, from start to finish. These elements ensure a streamlined process, and an end result we can all be proud of.

Weâ€™re human beings; stories define us. Itâ€™s one thing to have an exceptional product or service, but without a cohesive narrative tying a brand together (especially in an age of abbreviated attention spans), a message can be easily lost.

I work closely with you on establishing their brand narrative. Together, we determine the target audience, establish guidelines, generate a content strategy, and brainstorm novel ways to get the message out there.

And for existing brands, those for whom the voice is firmly engrained, I possess a well-honed ability to pair my own voice and aesthetic with an established identity.

With this considered, I help you fill in the blanks and define their intent. Before a single sentence of copy is written, everyone is on the same page, with goals solidly in place.

As a creative consultant as well as a content provider, I exercise a well-developed acumen in my field and expect a capacity for productive collaboration from you. Deadline-driven pieces are preferable: a career in magazines has hammered respect for delivery dates deeply into my workflow.

I'm also really easy to get along with, which, believe it or not, is one of the most important aspects of taking your idea and translating it to the page.

Please peruse the portfolio samples featured on my profile page. Should you require specific examples of writing/editing, references, or additional information, please let me know via private message
